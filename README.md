# Rock, Paper and Scissors Project

## Objective
Create an online version of the game where you can play against the HTTP server using Node.js[^1^][1].

## Questions
- How can you use the `http` module to create a server and handle different requests and responses?
- How can you use the `fs` module to read and stream HTML files to the response object?
- How can you use the `URL` object to extract the pathname and query parameters from the request URL?
- How can you use the `switch` statement to route requests based on the pathname and request method?[^2^][2]
- How can you use the `handlePostResponse` function to generate a random choice for the server and compare it with the user's choice?
- How can you use the `writeHead` method to write response headers with appropriate status codes and content types?
- How can you use the `createReadStream` and `pipe` methods to stream data from files to the response object?
